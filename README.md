#Project Description

Horiseon Marketing Agency requested to refactor their website
so that it uses semantic structure of HTML elements in order to
follow accessibility standards.

##Acceptancee Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
* WHEN I view the source code
  THEN I find semantic HTML elements

* WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
  THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

* WHEN I view the image elements
  THEN I find accessible alt attributes

* WHEN I view the heading attributes
  THEN they fall in sequential order

* WHEN I view the title element
  THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Changes

I added comments to the HTML and CSS files.
Numbering reflects the order that I followed when refactoring this website.
